    <p>Imagine you are going out to do some grocery shopping.
        So you have an array called shoppingList with all the products you want to buy. <br>
        Now that you are inside of the shop, you have a basket with all the products from your list, but you want to
        add a few more. <br>
        Create a new array called shoppingBasket, that will be a copy of the shoppingList array, and add some
        new products into it.</p>


    <script>

        let shoppingList = ['cooking oil', 'termeric', 'coconut', 'peanuts', 'ditergent'];

        let shoppingBasket = [...shoppingList];

        shoppingList.push('Rice','wheat');

        console.log(shoppingList);
        console.log(shoppingBasket);

    </script>        

</body>
